# Learning

This repo brings together my attempts at learning new languages outside of uni coursework.

For selected notes specifically from university coursework, please see [neon64/unimelb_lecture_notes](https://github.com/neon64/unimelb_lecture_notes/).

## Contents

Assorted notes all in Markdown format.

- [Haskell notes](haskell/haskell_features.md)
    - http://learnyouahaskell.com

- [C++ notes](cpp/README.md)
    - https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language
    - feels like a monstrous behemoth that I will never understand
    - I am not a note-taking person. Have tried out some ideas though in my [C++ OpenGL game engine](https://github.com/neon64/cpp_game_engine) repo.
   
- [PureScript notes (non-existent)](purescript/README.md)
- [Category theory for programmers](bartosz_milewski_blog.md)
- OCaml
    - interesting because mix of impure, OOP, as well as functional stuff
    - strict - so has more predictable performance
    - used by Jane Street and a few other companies, but seems like non Jane Street stdlib is lacking (e.g.: Unicode support)
    - a few syntactic oddities that I've found so far (?only 1 letter function arguments?, ?lowercase types?)

## Related ideas

- Exploring PureScript - links into my attempts to write web applications in Rust and compile to WASM (which is now a viable solution these days, e.g.: [Yew](https://github.com/yewstack/yew))

- Have wanted to invent an alternative front-end and whitespace-sensitive syntax for the Rust compiler - but need to understand Haskell better before attempting that.
