# Learning

This repo brings together my attempts at learning programming languages.

- (Modern) C++
  - https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language
  - feels like a monstrous behemoth that I will never understand
  - I am not a note-taking person. Have tried out some ideas though in my [C++ OpenGL game engine](https://github.com/neon64/cpp_game_engine) repo.

- Haskell
    - http://learnyouahaskell.com
    -  Now am doing a subject in Haskell ==> have strong impetus to learn it properly.
    - Type classes
        - analogue: traits in Rust / protocols in Swift / interfaces in Java
    - Records
        - analogue: structs in C
    - Monads / `do`-notation

- PureScript
    - compiles to JavaScript
    - strict evaluation (unlike Haskell)
    - want to understand PureScript-Halogen - a virtual-DOM-based web framework for PureScript
- OCaml
    - interesting because mix of impure, OOP, as well as functional stuff
    - strict - so has more predictable performance
    - used by Jane Street and a few other companies, but seems like non Jane Street stdlib is lacking (e.g.: Unicode support)
    - a few syntactic oddities that I've found so far (?only 1 letter function arguments?, ?lowercase types?)

- Exploring PureScript - links into my attempts to write web applications in Rust and compile to WASM (which is now a viable solution these days, e.g.: [Yew](https://github.com/yewstack/yew))

- Have wanted to invent an alternative front-end and whitespace-sensitive syntax for the Rust compiler - but need to understand Haskell better before attempting that.
