Collecting advice here for my future self, regarding learning PureScript

- Use `spago` instead of `psc-package`
  - (still old links out there)
  - spago worked super easily for me
  - 'package-sets' confused me - aren't they just the same as a central crates.io registry, for example? Why such a fuss.
